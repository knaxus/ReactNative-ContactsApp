## ðŸ‘‹ Intro

This boilerplate launches with a [React Native app](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). It shares the 'business logic' (_i.e. actions, containers, reducers_) across the platforms, whilst allowing flexibility in View components to ensure your project looks and feels native in each platform.

The project is _super_ helpful to kick-start your next project, as it provides a lot of the common tools you may reach for, all ready to go.  Weâ€™ll cover

- Scrolling lists
- Designing and creating reusable components
- Project organization
- Navigation
- Core APIs
- Installing third party packages
- And moreâ€¦

And weâ€™ll do this for both **iOS and Android.**

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

#### 1. Clone and Install

_*It's recommended that you install [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/releases) and open before `npm start`._

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/knaxus/ReactNative-ContactsApp.git

# cd into the diectory
cd ReactNative-ContactsApp

# Install dependencies
npm i
```

#### 2.1. Run the _React Native_ App

```bash
# Start the React Native packager
npm start

or

# After opening an AVD in emulator or connecting a physical device
# For Android 
react-native run-android

# For iOS
react-native run-ios
```

Instructions are shown in the terminal. You can select to open it in:

- An emulator (either iOS or Android)
- Your mobile device with the [Expo app](https://expo.io/). It will reload if you save edits to your files and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.
